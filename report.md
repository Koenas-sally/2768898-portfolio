I learned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, and footer. I also practiced organizing content in a way that improves accessibility and readability. Additionally, I gained experience using Git branches to isolate features and merge changes safely. This workflow helped reinforce best practices for version control and collaborative development.
